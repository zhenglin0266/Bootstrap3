Problem description: Generate a sample of size n as follows: sample x_1... x_n iid uniform from [0; 1]; sample d according to a Poisson distribution with mean 2; sample a_0...a_d iid standard normal; sample \sigma^2 from a exponential distribution from mean 0.1; sample \epsilon_1... \epsilon_n iid from the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance \sigma_2; and finally generate yi=\sum^d_{j=0}a_jx_i^j+\epsilon_i for i = 1...n.
